## How to Use These Rules

### For New Developers
1. Start with `scentsafe-architecture.md` to understand project structure
2. Read `scentsafe-coding-standards.md` for coding conventions
3. Follow `scentsafe-development-workflow.md` for daily development

### For Code Reviews
- Check compliance with architecture rules
- Verify coding standards are followed
- Ensure workflow processes are respected
- Use provided checklists

### For Project Maintenance
- Update rules as project evolves
- Add new patterns as they emerge
- Keep documentation current with Flutter updates
- Review and refine regularly

## Quick Reference

### Most Important Rules
1. **Always follow naming conventions** - consistency is key
2. **Document public APIs** - future you will thank present you
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - users expect robust apps
4. **Test thoroughly** - ML features need validation
5. **Dispose resources** - memory leaks kill performance
6. **Process locally** - privacy is non-negotiable
7. **Use Material Design** - platform consistency matters

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Architecture follows project structure
- [ ] Naming conventions are consistent
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Security best practices are followed
- [ ] Performance is considered
- [ ] UI follows Material Design

## Getting Help

If you need clarification on any rule:
1. Check the relevant rule file first
2. Look for examples in the codebase
3. Ask the team lead for guidance
4. Propose improvements if rules seem outdated

## Rule Updates

Rules should be updated when:
- New Flutter versions introduce better patterns
- Project requirements change significantly
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Performance issues reveal better approaches
- Team feedback suggests improvements

All rule updates should be:
- Discussed with the team
- Tested on existing code
- Documented with examples
- Communicated to all developers
